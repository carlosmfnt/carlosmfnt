### Hello! I’m Carlos. 👋

I'm a full-stack web developer and visual designer. Most of the stuff I develop is using either [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) or [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), but I'm always open to learn new languages and new frameworks!

+ 🧪 I'm currently testing Apple's Beta Software!
+ ⚛️ My current focus is set on learning React Native w/ Expo and excelling in Laravel.
+ ✨ Next.js, Laravel and TailwindCSS are some of my favourite frameworks.
+ 📫 For further information, feel free to contact me here: [carlos@carlosmfnt.com](mailto:carlos@carlosmfnt.com)
