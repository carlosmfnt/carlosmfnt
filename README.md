### Hello! Iâ€™m Carlos. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack web developer and designer, currently available for full-time roles & freelance projects. Most of the stuff I develop is using either [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) or [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/), but I'm always open to learn new languages and new frameworks!

If you want to take a look at some of my most recent work, feel free to check out some of it on my [portfolio](https://carlosmfnt.com)!
