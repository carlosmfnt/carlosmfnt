### Hello! I’m Carlos. 👋

I'm a full-stack developer and visual designer based in [Cartagena, Spain](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cartagena). Most of the stuff I develop is using either [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) or [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), but I'm always open to learn new languages and new frameworks!

+ 🧪 I just started building something pretty cool behind the scenes!
+ ⚛️ Right now, my focus is set on excelling in [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and learning [Vue](https://v3.vuejs.org/).
+ ✨ [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) are some of my favourite frameworks.
+ 🗃️ As for RDBMS, recently I have been working with [Oracle 12c](https://www.oracle.com/es/corporate/features/database-12c/) and [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/).
+ 📫 For further information, feel free to contact me here: [carlos@carlosmfnt.com](mailto:carlos@carlosmfnt.com).
